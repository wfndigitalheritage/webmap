At the confluence point between Mission Creek (River) and Okanagan Lake shore just to the south of Kelowna is an area that flooded every year and this area was one of the larger wet land areas along the Okanagan lake shore. This meant that it was a refuge area for all kinds of water fowl that nested along the shore line and out on the lake reeds. The hill side adjacent to this area was teeming with ground hogs, rabbits, game birds and bigger game. The village site just to the east of this area and bit further up the hill side was a community that looked after and maintained connection to other people in areas regarding the weather information and predictions which great knowledge keepers used as a method of land management. The lake current made getting back and forth across the lake easy traveling. This point and up the lake on the Westside at ""The Cove"" this area was a staging areas for north and north west travels the area back across and on the eastern benches was also a staging area for travelers going East to the High Lakes District or ""The Arrow Lakes"". The people also used this area as a point to get ready for their travels the three major Huckle Berry areas like Silver star mountains, Monashee slopes and high benches also up and over to the Granite mountain areas.",

The people of the West Bank community were the care takers for a very important resource for many because of the way that this resource impacted all of the people's collective daily lives. It helped them live comfortably even in the extremist of conditions. It defended the people from starvation. It kept the people from freezing. It helped the people proactively keep themselves safe from harm of any kind be it from the powerhouse animals of the land or other people who would want to bring harm against them or others. This valuable item was to  become known as the ""Flint Rock"". It could start a fire, it helped the people cook raw foods, used properly it could start a fire in the wind and snow or in the rain. It was made into knives, arrow heads, chopping tools, canoe carving blades and or axes. The versatility of this item was second to none. The extreme versatility of this item was even tested by scientists. A scalpel was fastened by a doctor to pit its edge against that of a highly tempered scalpel blade, not only did the flint cut more superior against the metal one it even out lasted the weaker metal one.",

Before there were any non native people living in the area which has since become known as ""West Kelowna"" it  was known in the Okanagan Language as the ""Windy Ridges Marsh Lands"" or West Bank. The people who lived along the shores off of the Okanagan Lake at West Bank, these people and a neighboring southern community had the collective responsibility for looking after the Antler Beach area as it was one of the most important fisheries for the delicious red and green land locked salmon known as ""Kokanee"". This fresh water resource was one of the staple dietary needs for the peoples of the area. So their collective duties was to maintain the information for things like full count return cycles, low count return cycles, spawning beds in that area that needed adequate shade for proper spawning temperature in the water, even making sure that the spawned salmon was put on shore for the other animals to consume. For all time this management system continued generation after generation ensuring that never at anytime in the people's future will this resource and/ or area suffer. For, should it suffer in any way then so shall the people suffer.",

(Caucasians) there were many Pronghorn Antelopes living along the area from Bear Creek turn off of Westside road to the Rocky hill sides south of the ""Cove"". From the western Lake Shore and to the west both sides of the ridges were where these unique ungulates ranged. The Okanagan term ""Lots-a-Poop"" was because of the piles of droppings that the male or ""The Buck"" of this species made and the height of these were quite impressive. The stallion or ""Stud"" horse does much the same thing. This necessary bodily function which was a way of marking the land by the males helped with maintaining domination over areas securing prime breeding areas and birthing zones. The wild life management methods that were committed to by the people and thorough this maintenance method the people kept these animals from extinction.",
